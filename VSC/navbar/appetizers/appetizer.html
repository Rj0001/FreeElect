This is a simple and quick Filipino dessert recipe that only takes less than 25 minutes to prepare. This is considered as a comfort food by some people that I know. The appearance of this dessert is similar to that of the Maja Blanca but there is a big difference in texture; the consistency is more like the Goto, Arroz Caldo, or perhaps the Champorado. </p> </td>

It requires only a few ingredients, which you could find at your local supermarket. Some of these ingredients include: shrimp, cornstarch, and peppercorn. The batter made is then deep-fried in a pan until crispy. It is usually served with vinegar as the dipping sauce. This dish is perfect to eat on its own or with rice!</p></td>

                                    <td><p>Chicharon, one of the best yet deadly snacks in the Philippines. Now why deadly? Because this dish/snack is made out of deep fried pork rinds but sometimes beef, Buffalo or chicken skin can be used, which means its high in cholesterol.  Now why best? Because it tastes so good, it’s addictive.  It is a common beer match in the Philippines which makes it even worse and I guess it’s one of those bad eating habits of Filipinos where they eat oily snacks such as this one while having some happy hour with friends.</p></td>
